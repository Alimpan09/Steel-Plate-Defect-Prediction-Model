# Steel-Plate-Defect-Prediction-Model
Using different Machine Learning Model, It is a trained prediction model which can predict Lung Cancer by taking various features as input with approximately 90% accuracy.
# Dataset Description
The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Steel Plates Faults dataset from UCI. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.
